## TLDR

The group project is spread out over a four week period. During Week 1 project teams will have a kick-off session where participants form teams, work towards defining a specific problem, and then sketch out a solution to solve their identified problem. Week 2 and week 3 will involve development and testing of their solution. Week 4 will feature team innovation pitches during our final class.

## Deliverable description

Project teams must build and deliver a product. 

1. Use HTML, CSS, and JS to build a Todo List web app.
2. The UI/UX is completely up to you, though it must be responsive and at a minimum enable users to view, add, mark as done, and delete `todos`. 
3. Using user centered design principles, consider what additional properties and features your users may need for an awesome Todo list. 
4. Your `todos` are going to have, at a minimum, a `title`, and `done` status.
5. You should also have an awesome empty state when a user first opens your app ([examples](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/empty-state-ux-design)).  
6. Though not required, consider "branding" your app with a cool product name, and logo. 


* Publish your code to GitHub using the GitHub classrooms generated repository for your team
* Use the GitHub Pages service to host your pages or you may use an alternative hosting service 
* Ensure you have a license file in your repository (recommend MIT license)
* Ensure you have the group project readme.md file in your repository

## Presentation description 

The project team must deliver a 10 (min) - 12 (max) minute engaging, well rehearsed presentation, which includes a live demo of the product as a part of the presentation.

During the presentation the whole team should be introduced, a live demo provided, and then further details about the product presented. The presentation may include information on the problem the product is solving, speak to the concept of the product, inspiration, challenges, future opportunities, and anything else the project team deems valuable to share.

All members of the project team must be in attendance during the in class presentation. In addition, all team members must speak during the presentation, though it does not have to be for completely equal times.

  <dt>Do I have to put comments in my code?</dt>
  <dd>No! You do not need to comment your code. That being said, it is an industry best practice to add comments to your code, so I would recommend that you add comments to your code where it makes sense, but this is not required.</dd>
  
  <dt>Does the web page / web app have to work in both mobile and desktop?</dt>
  <dd>Yes! You must build your app to be completely responsive.</dd>
  
  <dt>Will accessbility be considered when reviewing our project deliverable?</dt>

  <dt>Can I use lorem ipsum text in my web page / web app?</dt>
  <dd>You may use lorem ipsum if you need to but ideally by now you should be using relevant content in your projects. Though, if you don't have relevant content you are absolutely permitted to use <a href="https://www.lipsum.com">lorem ipsum</a>, <a href="https://baconipsum.com">bacon ipsum</a>, or <a href="https://veganipsum.me">vegan ipsum</a> in your designs. Keep in mind that this should not be used in cases where the meaning of the text is important, for example the call to action buttons in the hero.</dd>
 
  <dt>Can I use trademarked or copywritten material on my page?</dt>
